<p>I have been intrested in Bitcoin for many years and with this site you get a quick glance that isn't too overwhelming on how it's doing. It will only show you the current price compared to yesterdays price. 
The site has a design that is heavily inspired by the site vecka.nu because it's so good. You get the jist in less than a second, all you need to know boom straight in your face.</p>
 <br>
<p>This started out as a school assignment and the conditions that we had to fulfill were:</p>
<div>
  <ul  style="list-style-type: disc;">
   <summary>
<li>The site has to be dynamic</li>
<li>The site has to fetch some data using an API and display it</li>
<li>The site has to done with vanilla JS, <s>no frameworks!</s> </li>
 </summary></ul></div>

<p>Half way thru the project I got inspired and wanted to make this in to a real site and bought the domain. </p>
